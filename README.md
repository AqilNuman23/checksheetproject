# Checksheet Project using Laravel 12

## About Project

I am just having fun to understand this new Laravel 12. So I contact my friend and ask about their job.
Offer myself to create a website to help with it (and maybe getting a contract from their company LOL).

Its about a Checksheet delivery.
The Checksheet is a document that is used to check the quality of a product or service.

From what I understand, there will be 2 party involve in this process.

-   Quality Engineer (which receive and regulate the checksheet)
-   Supplier (who responsible for submitting the checksheet)

The website will be used to create, edit, and deliver the Checksheet.
The user will be able to create a new Checksheet, edit an existing one, and deliver it
The website will also have a dashboard to display all the Checksheet that have been created, edited,
and delivered.

It can be very challenging as there will be more advance scope I need to learn from this job.
But I am excited to learn and get the experience.

## Understand the Scope better

Relay

-   User 1 : 1 Company

User are divided to 3 roles:
